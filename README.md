# html5-canvas-site

A simple experiment in using HTML5 Canvas to create a website instead of using CSS.

NOTE: Because of CORS, requires hosting on an Apache server, eg using XAMPP.

## How it looks and behaves

## Conclusion

Javascript is an abomination. Cast it into the fire with CSS.

People should use Typescript instead.

(Getting rid of Java applets was a sin, along with maybe getting rid of Silverlight.)
